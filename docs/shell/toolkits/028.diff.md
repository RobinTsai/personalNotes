# diff

```sh
diff -u 3 FILE_1 FILE_2 # 输出上下 3 行（一般就用这个）

diff FILE_1 FILE_2      # < 后的是 FILE_1，> 后的是 FILE_2，= 表示对比一致
diff -C 3 FILE_1 FILE_2 # 输出上下 3 行，
diff -e FILE_1 FILE_2   # 输出一个 ed 命令，这个命令可以编辑文件
diff -y FILE_1 FILE_2   # side by side 输出

-i # ignore case
-w # ignore all space
-b # ignore space change
```
